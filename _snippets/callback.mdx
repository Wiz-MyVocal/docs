## About Callback

<p>Some of the API services provided by this product require asynchronous callbacks due to longer processing times.</p>
<p>To ensure that information is returned normally and accurately, a callback URL needs to be provided in the input parameters.</p>

### Request
Please provide a callback URL and ensure that the callback URL provided is consistent across different scenarios. If the callback URL varies, there may be inconsistencies between the callback URL used during the callback and the callback URL you provided at the time of the request.
