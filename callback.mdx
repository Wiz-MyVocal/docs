<p>Some of the API services provided by this product require asynchronous callbacks due to longer processing times.</p>
<p>To ensure that information is returned normally and accurately, a callback URL needs to be provided in the input parameters.</p>

### Request
<p>Please provide a callback URL and ensure that the callback URL provided is consistent across different scenarios.</p>

<p>Please make sure that the url you provide is accessible to the public network and that the request type is <b>POST</b>.</p>

<p>If the callback URL varies, there may be inconsistencies between the callback URL used during the callback and the callback URL you provided at the time of the request.</p>

### Response
When an asynchronous request is sent successfully, we will immediately provide a webhookId. When a callback is made, this webhookId will also be included in the callback URL. You can use the webhookId to associate the request with the callback.

<ResponseField name="webhookId" type="string">
  When the request is successfully sent, a webhoodId will be synchronously returned. The same information will also be called back in the callbackUrl, which is used to correlate the request and the response.
